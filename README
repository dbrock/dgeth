dgeth(1) --- Go Ethereum Docker wrapper
=======================================

Run geth(1) as a Docker container hooked up to the local network and
file system --- almost as if running directly on the host machine.

By default, `~/.ethereum' is bind-mounted into the container.

Note: To change the datadir, please set the `datadir' variable
(instead of passing the `--datadir' option) to enable dgeth(1) to
mount that directory into the container instead of `~/.ethereum'.

To mount additional volumes, set `volumes="-v /a:/a -v /b:/b"'.

To change the name of the container, set `name=foo'.  To run the
container in the background, set `lifecycle=--detach'.

By default, the container is placed inside the host's network stack.
To use a containerized network stack, set `network=--net=default'.

Any command-line arguments are passed directly to geth(1).
